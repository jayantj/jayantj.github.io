I recently open-sourced a library to analyze topics and themes from news articles. You can find the library [here](https://github.com/jayantj/news-analyze), and a notebook with a demo on Hacker News articles [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jayantj/news-analyze/blob/master/notebooks/Analyze%20HN%20using%20NLP!.ipynb).

The main goal of this early release is to get feedback about the following - 
1. Specific applications where this could be useful
2. Other datasets on which the library could be used
3. New features that could be helpful
4. Problems with existing features
5. Improvements to the API and usage docs

Please do have a look at the [library](https://github.com/jayantj/news-analyze)/[demo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jayantj/news-analyze/blob/master/notebooks/Analyze%20HN%20using%20NLP!.ipynb), and get in touch at <jayantjain1992@gmail.com> if you have any ideas. Feel free to do so if you wish to talk about NLP generally either!
