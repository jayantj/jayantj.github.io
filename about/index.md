I'm an MS CS student at Georgia Tech right now, and expect to graduate in May 2020. Before this, I was an R&D Engineer working with [RaRe Technologies](https://rare-technologies.com/), a company that works on projects involving NLP and Machine Learning in a wide variety of domains. We are also the maintainers of [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim), a popular open source library for unsupervised learning in NLP.

I've worked on both commercial and open source projects for the company. We often create well-designed, scalable implementations of practically useful models from research papers and open source them as part of Gensim. The last such project I did was implementing [Poincare Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08039.pdf), a model from a paper by Facebook AI Research to learn vector representations of nodes from a graph with hierarchical information. We wrote a blog post about it [here](https://rare-technologies.com/implementing-poincare-embeddings/).

I've previously been a mentor in Google Summer of Code 2017 for a project to implement [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) - a model to learn word representations from an unstructured text corpus using character n-grams - as part of Gensim. I've also written [an analysis](https://jayantj.github.io/posts/fasttext-gensim-word-embeddings) of how the embedding does in comparison to word2vec.

One of my primary interests is using NLP to analyze large-scale text corpuses on the web in order to understand society at large. I'm particularly interested in social media data and news articles - I've published an [open source library](https://github.com/jayantj/news-analyze) to perform exploratory analysis of news corpora in order to find topics and trends in them. Here, you can see a [demo of the library](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jayantj/news-analyze/blob/master/notebooks/Analyze%20HN%20using%20NLP!.ipynb) on a dataset of Hacker News articles. I've also delved into a fun project on coming up with a novel (to the best of my knowledge) method to cluster classic literature available from Project Gutenberg by using word2vec. You can [read about it here](http://jayantj.github.io/posts/project-gutenberg-word2vec).

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2015 with a degree in mechanical engineering and knowledge of a lot of things unrelated. I spent a lot of time in college with a student group, [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/) (Software Development Section), a bunch of smart geeks who make cool web and mobile applications. I participated in quite a few hackathons with them, winning a couple. I was very interested in game development in college, being part of Google's open source program, Google Summer of Code 2014 with [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/), and interning in a game dev startup, Edlogiq in 2013.

When I'm not doing any of that, I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9858064?shelf=read), especially classic sci-fi and dystopian fiction. I also like to trek, travel and listen to blues and classic rock. Feel free to contact me at [jayantjain1992@gmail.com](mailto:jayantjain1992@gmail.com).
